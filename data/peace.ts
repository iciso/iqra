            question: "What is the foundational Islamic principle for peacemaking?",
            options: [
              "Justice (Adl)",
              "Military superiority",
              "Economic sanctions",
              "Cultural assimilation"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Justice (Adl)",
            explanation: "The Quran states: 'Be maintainers of justice' (4:135). Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) established the Constitution of Medina ensuring justice for all communities. True peace requires addressing root injustices while avoiding oppression (5:8). The FBA peacemaking guide emphasizes justice as prerequisite for lasting peace."

            question: "How does Islam view interfaith dialogue for peace?",
            options: [
              "Forbidden as it dilutes faith",
              "Required with wisdom and good debate",
              "Only permitted among Muslims",
              "Limited to political discussions"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Required with wisdom and good debate",
            explanation: "The Quran commands: 'Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best' (16:125). Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) engaged Christian delegations (Hadith - Bukhari 1356) and Jewish scholars in respectful dialogue. The FBA guide highlights dialogue's role in conflict prevention."

          {
            question: "What Quranic principle governs relations with non-Muslim communities?",
            options: [
              "No relations permitted",
              "Cooperation in goodness only",
              "Full social integration required",
              "Temporary truces only"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Cooperation in goodness only",
            explanation: "Allah says: 'Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you... and cooperate with them in righteousness and piety' (60:8-9). The Prophet's treaties with Jewish tribes (Constitution of Medina) and Christians (Najran Pact) established mutual rights/responsibilities. Modern applications include interfaith humanitarian projects."

            question: "Which Islamic concept promotes peaceful coexistence?",
            options: [
              "Dar al-Islam vs Dar al-Harb dichotomy",
              "Ummah (global community) inclusivity",
              "Permanent jihad",
              "Religious isolationism"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Ummah (global community) inclusivity",
            explanation: "The Quran addresses humanity: 'O mankind! We created you from a single pair' (49:13). The Prophet's Farewell Sermon established equality. Modern scholars like Shaykh Abdullah bin Bayyah emphasize 'Wasatiyyah' (moderation) in building inclusive societies while maintaining Islamic identity."
          },
          {
            question: "What was the Prophet's approach to territorial disputes?",
            options: [
              "Immediate military action",
              "Negotiated settlements",
              "Complete withdrawal",
              "Economic warfare"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Negotiated settlements",
            explanation: "The Treaty of Hudaybiyyah (628 CE) demonstrated conflict resolution through: 1) Dialogue (Hadith - Bukhari 2731), 2) Compromise (apparent in unfavorable terms), 3) Long-term vision (Quran 48:1). The FBA guide cites this as model for modern peace processes where neither side achieves all demands initially."
          },
          {
            question: "How does Islam view the sanctity of peace treaties?",
            options: [
              "Permits breaking them if advantageous",
              "Binding until expiration or violation by others",
              "Only valid between Muslims",
              "Not recognized in Islamic law"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Binding until expiration or violation by others",
            explanation: "The Quran commands: 'Fulfill the covenant of Allah when you have taken it' (16:91). Breaking treaties is severely condemned (8:56). Exceptions exist only for self-defense against treaty violators (9:4). Modern applications include honoring UN resolutions and bilateral agreements per Islamic contract law."
          },
          {
            question: "What is the Islamic ruling on targeting civilians in conflicts?",
            options: [
              "Permitted if they support enemies",
              "Strictly prohibited",
              "Allowed during retaliation",
              "Only women/children are protected"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Strictly prohibited",
            explanation: "The Prophet (PBUH) forbade killing non-combatants (Hadith - Abu Dawud 2614). Quranic rules of war include: 'Do not transgress limits' (2:190). The Amman Message (2004) reaffirmed this prohibition. Contemporary scholars like Dr. Tim Winter (Abdal Hakim Murad) emphasize its relevance to modern warfare ethics."

          {
            question: "Which Quranic verse is called the 'Peace Verse'?",
            options: [
              "2:190 (Fight in the way of Allah)",
              "8:61 (If they incline to peace)",
              "9:5 (Fight the polytheists)",
              "47:4 (Strike their necks)"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "8:61 (If they incline to peace)",
            explanation: "The verse states: 'If they incline to peace, then incline to it' (8:61). This establishes: 1) Peace as default, 2) Reciprocity principle, 3) Openness to enemy initiatives. Scholars like Imam al-Ghazali interpreted this as preferring political solutions over military ones whenever possible."
          },
          {
            question: "What Islamic principle limits warfare?",
            options: [
              "Military necessity",
              "Total war doctrine",
              "Collective punishment",
              "Scorched earth tactics"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Military necessity",
            explanation: "Islamic just war theory (fiqh al-jihad) requires: 1) Legitimate authority (Hadith - Abu Dawud 2614), 2) Proportionality (2:194), 3) Avoiding environmental damage (Hadith - Abu Dawud 2614). The FBA guide applies these to modern conflicts, prohibiting tactics causing disproportionate civilian harm."
          },
          {
            question: "How did the Prophet handle defeated enemies?",
            options: [
              "Mass executions",
              "Enslavement of populations",
              "Mercy and rehabilitation",
              "Forced conversions"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Mercy and rehabilitation",
            explanation: "After conquering Mecca, the Prophet (PBUH) declared general amnesty: 'Go, you are free' (Hadith - Bayhaqi). This established post-conflict reconciliation models. Modern applications include truth commissions and restorative justice programs in line with Quranic forgiveness principles (3:134)."
          },
          {
            question: "What is the Islamic view on hostage-taking?",
            options: [
              "Permitted as deterrence",
              "Allowed only for prisoner exchange",
              "Completely prohibited",
              "Only for ransom payments"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Completely prohibited",
            explanation: "The Prophet (PBUH) forbade taking civilians hostage (Hadith - Abu Dawud 2686). Quranic rules of war distinguish combatants from non-combatants (2:190). Contemporary fatwas like those from Al-Azhar (2015) condemn groups using hostage-taking as terrorism, not legitimate jihad."
          },
          {
            question: "Which Islamic principle protects religious sites during wars?",
            options: [
              "Only mosques are protected",
              "All houses of worship are inviolable",
              "Enemy religious sites can be targeted",
              "Protection only during truces"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "All houses of worship are inviolable",
            explanation: "The Prophet (PBUH) prohibited destroying churches/synagogues (Hadith - Abu Yusuf). Caliph Umar's covenant with Jerusalem Christians guaranteed church protection. Modern scholars cite Quran 22:40 ('Had not Allah checked one set of people...') as basis for interfaith heritage preservation in conflict zones."
          },
          {
            question: "What is the Islamic approach to refugees from conflict zones?",
            options: [
              "Accept only Muslim refugees",
              "Grant temporary asylum",
              "Provide permanent protection",
              "Deport all refugees"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Provide permanent protection",
            explanation: "The Quran praises the Ansar who hosted Muhajireen: 'They love those who migrated to them' (59:9). The Prophet (PBUH) granted asylum even to polytheists (Hadith - Abu Dawud 2686). Modern Islamic refugee law (fiqh al-laji'in) builds on these precedents, requiring protection regardless of faith."
          },
          {
            question: "How does Islam view peacekeeping missions?",
            options: [
              "Forbidden foreign interference",
              "Permitted to protect civilians",
              "Only Muslim nations can participate",
              "Must enforce sharia immediately"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Permitted to protect civilians",
            explanation: "Quranic commands to 'stand out firmly for justice' (4:135) support multilateral interventions to prevent atrocities. Conditions include: 1) UN authorization, 2) Neutrality, 3) Humanitarian purpose. The FBA guide cites Prophet's (PBUH) arbitration in tribal disputes as model for modern peacekeeping."
          },
          {
            question: "What is the Islamic position on war reparations?",
            options: [
              "Only victors receive compensation",
              "Mutual reparations for damages",
              "No compensation required",
              "Only for Muslim victims"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Mutual reparations for damages",
            explanation: "The Treaty of Hudaybiyyah included mutual compensation clauses. Islamic law (fiqh al-mu'amalat) requires restitution for unjust damage (Hadith - Muslim 1681). Modern applications include compensation funds for war victims, as seen in post-conflict Iraq reconciliation initiatives advised by Islamic scholars."
          },
          {
            question: "Which Quranic term describes peaceful coexistence?",
            options: [
              "Hudna (truce)",
              "Sulh (reconciliation)",
              "Qital (fighting)",
              "Ghanimah (spoils)"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Sulh (reconciliation)",
            explanation: "The Quran states: 'Reconciliation is best' (4:128). Sulh involves: 1) Conflict resolution (Hadith - Abu Dawud 3594), 2) Forgiveness (3:134), 3) Future cooperation. Distinguished from temporary hudna (truce), sulh aims for lasting peace. The FBA guide highlights its use in modern intercommunal mediation."
          },
          {
            question: "How did early Muslims handle interfaith tensions?",
            options: [
              "Forced conversions",
              "Ghettoization of minorities",
              "Equal citizenship with rights",
              "Expulsion of all non-Muslims"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Equal citizenship with rights",
            explanation: "The Constitution of Medina granted Jews equal citizenship with mutual defense obligations. Caliph Umar's covenant with Jerusalem Christians guaranteed religious freedom. Modern scholars like Dr. Umar Faruq Abd-Allah cite these as models for pluralistic societies under Islamic governance frameworks."
          },
          {
            question: "What is the Islamic view on autonomous regions for minorities?",
            options: [
              "Allowed with mutual agreement",
              "Forbidden as it divides the ummah",
              "Only for Muslim minorities",
              "Permitted temporarily"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Allowed with mutual agreement",
            explanation: "The Prophet (PBUH) recognized Jewish self-governance in Medina under the Constitution. Islamic legal maxim: 'Custom has the weight of law' supports local autonomy arrangements if they maintain overall justice. The FBA guide notes this principle's relevance to federalism debates in Muslim-majority states."
          },
          {
            question: "How does Islam approach post-conflict reconciliation?",
            options: [
              "Vengeance is encouraged",
              "Truth and reconciliation processes",
              "Collective punishment",
              "Silence about past crimes"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Truth and reconciliation processes",
            explanation: "The Quran commands: 'Repel evil with what is better' (41:34). Prophet (PBUH) forgave his Meccan persecutors. Modern applications include South Africa-style truth commissions informed by Islamic forgiveness principles (3:134) while ensuring justice (4:135). The FBA guide emphasizes restorative justice models."
          },
          {
            question: "What is the Islamic ruling on collective punishment?",
            options: [
              "Permitted against enemy populations",
              "Allowed only in retaliation",
              "Strictly prohibited",
              "Only for treason cases"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Strictly prohibited",
            explanation: "The Quran states: 'No soul bears another's burden' (6:164). Prophet (PBUH) prohibited punishing communities for individuals' crimes (Hadith - Abu Dawud 4369). This Islamic legal principle invalidates modern tactics like blockade warfare affecting civilians, as condemned by ICJ rulings citing Islamic law."
          },
          {
            question: "Which Islamic principle governs war prisoners?",

              "Ransom payments only"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Humane treatment and eventual release",
            explanation: "The Quran commands: 'They feed the poor, the orphan and the captive out of love for Him' (76:8). Prophet (PBUH) set captives free after teaching literacy (Hadith - Bukhari 3046). Modern Islamic humanitarian law requires POW treatment meeting Geneva Convention standards."
          },
          {
            question: "How does Islam view neutrality in conflicts?",
            options: [
              "Forbidden - must take sides",
              "Permitted for non-combatants",
              "Only Muslim nations can be neutral",
              "Considered cowardice"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Permitted for non-combatants",
            explanation: "Quranic rules distinguish combatants from civilians (2:190). Islamic law recognizes neutral parties (musta'minun) who cannot be attacked. The FBA guide applies this to modern neutral states/organizations providing humanitarian aid in conflict zones per Prophet's (PBUH) protection of non-combatants."
          },
          {
            question: "What is the Islamic approach to war propaganda?",

              "Only visual propaganda allowed",
              "Bans all war reporting"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Requires truthfulness even in war",
            explanation: "The Quran forbids lying: 'Do not conceal testimony' (2:283). Prophet (PBUH) prohibited spreading panic (Hadith - Muslim 4722). Modern applications include ethical war journalism standards prohibiting fake news/dehumanization, as emphasized in Islamic media ethics charters from Al-Azhar."
          },
          {
            question: "How does Islam view economic cooperation with former enemies?",
            options: [
              "Forbidden permanently",
              "Allowed post-conflict reconciliation",
              "Only for essential goods",
              "Permitted if they convert"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Allowed post-conflict reconciliation",
            explanation: "The Quran permits trade with former enemies: 'Perhaps Allah will bring about affection between you' (60:7). Post-Hudaybiyyah, Muslims traded with former Meccan adversaries. Modern examples include joint economic zones in post-conflict areas, endorsed by Islamic economists as peacebuilding tools."

            ],
            correctAnswer: "Must include all casualties",
            explanation: "Islamic tradition values remembering lessons of history (12:111) while avoiding glorification of violence. Balanced memorialization includes: 1) Recognizing all victims (Hadith - Muslim 4650), 2) Emphasizing peace lessons, 3) Avoiding idolatry (Hadith - Bukhari 318). The FBA guide recommends inclusive memorial designs."

            question: "How does Islam view peace education?",
            options: [
              "Only military training matters",

            correctAnswer: "Core part of Islamic education",
            explanation: "The Quran teaches: 'Repel evil with what is better' (41:34). Prophet's (PBUH) teachings emphasized conflict prevention (Hadith - Bukhari 6233). Modern Islamic education integrates peace studies through: 1) Sirah lessons on treaties, 2) Quranic conflict resolution, 3) Interfaith understanding - as promoted by ISESCO programs."

              "Only nuclear disarmament matters"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Balance between deterrence and peace",
            explanation: "The Quran commands: 'Prepare against them what you can' (8:60) while preferring peace (8:61). Islamic jurisprudence allows arms control treaties if they maintain just deterrence. Modern applications include WMD non-proliferation agreements endorsed by OIC resolutions, provided they apply equally to all parties."

            correctAnswer: "Collective responsibility including former enemies",
            explanation: "The Quran praises those who 'repair what corruption has done' (30:41). Caliph Ali prioritized rebuilding after battles (Nahj al-Balagha). Modern Islamic development models emphasize: 1) Inclusive reconstruction, 2) Environmental restoration (Hadith - Abu Dawud 2614), 3) Trauma healing - as seen in post-ISIS Mosul rebuilding projects."

            ],
            correctAnswer: "Must remain accessible to all civilians",
            explanation: "The Prophet (PBUH) prohibited poisoning wells (Hadith - Abu Dawud 2614), establishing water as a protected right for all. Quranic principles of preserving life (5:32) and environmental protection (30:41) require maintaining water access during wars. Modern applications include protecting dams and water infrastructure in conflict zones like Yemen and Syria."

            question: "What is the Islamic ruling on rebuilding houses of worship destroyed in conflicts?",
            options: [
                "Only mosques should be rebuilt",
                "All destroyed religious sites must be restored",
                "Leave ruins as war memorials",
                "Rebuild only if Muslims will use them"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "All destroyed religious sites must be restored",
            explanation: "The Quran commands: 'Had not Allah checked one set of people... monasteries, churches, synagogues would have been pulled down' (22:40). Caliph Umar rebuilt Jerusalem's churches after conquest. Modern fatwas (like Dar al-Ifta Egypt 2017) require post-conflict restoration of all religious sites, as seen in the reconstruction of Mosul's churches and Yazidi temples."

            options: [
                "Excluded from all negotiations",
                "Can participate as mediators and witnesses",
                "Only permitted in educational roles",
                "Allowed only if no men are available"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Can participate as mediators and witnesses",
            explanation: "The Quran records women like Umm Kulthum serving as witnesses (60:12). Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) accepted Umm Salamah's crucial advice during Hudaybiyyah negotiations (Hadith - Ahmad 27425). Modern applications include OIC Resolution 5/45-LEG (2018) promoting women's inclusion in Islamic peacebuilding, exemplified by Yemeni women's mediation networks."

              "Trauma is divine punishment"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Integrated spiritual-psychological care",
            explanation: "The Quran describes post-combat healing: 'Allah sent down tranquility' (48:4). Prophetic methods included: 1) Community storytelling (12:111), 2) Art therapy (Hadith - Bukhari 3046), 3) Nature retreats (Hadith - Muslim 7082). Modern Islamic psychology integrates CBT with dhikr (remembrance) and Quranic reflection therapies."
